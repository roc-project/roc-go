Go bindings for Roc
-------------------

_Work in progress!_

```
go get github.com/roc-project/roc-go/roc
```

# Dependencies
You will need to have libroc and libroc-devel (headers) installed. Refer to official build [instructions](https://roc-project.github.io/roc/docs/building.html) on how to install libroc. There is no official distribution for any os as of now, you will need to install from source.

# Build
Will not produce any lib/binary. It's just to check for the syntax errors:

`make build`

# Test

`make test`
